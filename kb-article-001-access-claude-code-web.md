## Overview
Claude Code Web is a browser-based coding assistant that allows you to delegate development tasks to Claude without using the command line. This guide shows you how to access the platform and verify your eligibility to use it.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended)
- An active internet connection
- A Claude Pro or Claude Max subscription (required for Claude Code Web access)

## Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Claude Code Web

Open your web browser and go to the official Claude Code Web URL:

```
https://claude.com/code
```

Alternatively, you can:
1. Visit `https://claude.com`
2. Look for the "Code" option in the main navigation menu
3. Click on "Code" to be redirected to `claude.com/code`

### Step 2: Verify Your Account Status

Once you land on the Claude Code Web page, the system will check your subscription status:

- **If you have an active Pro or Max subscription**: You'll see the Claude Code Web interface with options to connect repositories
- **If you don't have a qualifying subscription**: You'll see a message prompting you to upgrade to Claude Pro or Claude Max

### Step 3: Familiarize Yourself with the Interface

After successful access, you should see:
- A welcome screen or dashboard
- Options to connect your GitHub account (if not already connected)
- Access to connect repositories
- Any existing Claude Code sessions (if you've used it before)

## Expected Results

Upon successful access, you should:
- See the Claude Code Web interface load completely
- Have the ability to interact with connection options for GitHub
- See clear indicators of your subscription tier (Pro or Max)
- Have no error messages blocking your access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue 1
**Problem**: Page shows "Access Denied" or subscription required message
**Solution**: Verify that you have an active Claude Pro or Claude Max subscription. If you just subscribed, try logging out and logging back in, or wait a few minutes for the subscription to activate.

### Common Issue 2
**Problem**: Page doesn't load or shows a connection error
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Try clearing your browser cache and cookies
- Try accessing the page in an incognito/private browsing window
- Ensure you're using a supported browser with JavaScript enabled

### Common Issue 3
**Problem**: Already logged into Claude but can't access Code Web
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged into the correct Claude account that has the Pro or Max subscription. You may have multiple accounts and need to switch.
