## Overview
When you have multiple repositories connected to Claude Code Web, you'll need to switch between them to work on different projects. This guide shows you how to navigate between repositories quickly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites
- Active Claude Pro or Max subscription
- At least two repositories connected to Claude Code Web
- Access to Claude Code Web interface

## Steps

### Step 1: Access the Repository Selection Interface

1. Navigate to `https://claude.com/code`
2. You should see your dashboard with connected repositories

### Step 2: Locate Your Connected Repositories

Look for one of these UI elements:

**Repository List/Grid:**
- Main dashboard showing all connected repos
- Cards or tiles for each repository
- List view with repository names

**Repository Dropdown:**
- Dropdown menu in the header
- Current repository name with a down arrow
- Click to expand the list

**Navigation Sidebar:**
- Left or right sidebar with repository names
- Expandable repository section

### Step 3: Select the Desired Repository

**Option 1: Click on Repository Card**
1. Find the repository you want to work on
2. Click on its card/tile
3. You'll be taken to that repository's view

**Option 2: Use Repository Dropdown**
1. Click the current repository name or dropdown
2. Browse or search for the desired repository
3. Click to select

**Option 3: Recent Repositories**
- Many interfaces show recently accessed repos
- Quick access to your most-used projects

### Step 4: Verify Repository Switch

After switching, confirm you're in the correct repository:
- Repository name displayed in the header
- Correct repository details shown
- File structure matches the expected project
- Branch information corresponds to the selected repo

### Step 5: Start Working

Once in the correct repository, you can:
- Create new tasks
- View existing sessions for this repo
- Browse the file structure
- Review recent activity

## Expected Results

After switching repositories, you should:
- See the selected repository's name prominently displayed
- Have access to that repository's files and branches
- Be able to create tasks specific to this repository
- See session history for the selected repository
- Have the correct repository context for all operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue 1
**Problem**: Can't find a specific repository in the list
**Solution**:
- Use the search function if available
- Check if the repository is actually connected (see KB-004)
- Verify you didn't disconnect it accidentally
- Ensure you have permissions to access that repository
- Try refreshing the page

### Common Issue 2
**Problem**: Repository switch doesn't seem to work
**Solution**:
- Refresh the page after switching
- Verify the repository name changed in the header
- Check if you're looking at the right project files
- Clear browser cache if the interface seems stuck
- Try clicking the repository again

### Common Issue 3
**Problem**: Tasks from previous repository still showing
**Solution**:
- Filter tasks by repository if the option exists
- Look for "All Repositories" vs. specific repo filters
- Each repository should have its own task list
- Make sure you're viewing the correct tab or section

## Additional Tips
- Most interfaces show your current repository prominently
- You can have tasks running in multiple repositories simultaneously
- Switching repositories doesn't affect running tasks
- Consider bookmarking frequently-used repositories
- Some interfaces allow favoriting or pinning repositories
- Repository switching is instant—no loading or syncing required
