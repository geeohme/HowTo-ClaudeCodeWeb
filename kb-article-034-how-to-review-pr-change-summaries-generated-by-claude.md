## Overview
Claude Code Web automatically generates comprehensive pull request summaries when creating PRs, including change descriptions, test plans, and reviewer guidance. This guide teaches you how to effectively review these AI-generated summaries to ensure they accurately represent the changes, identify potential issues, and provide complete context for your team's review process.

## Prerequisites
- Active Claude Code Web session with a connected repository
- A PR created by Claude Code Web (either auto-generated or manually requested)
- Basic understanding of pull request workflows
- Familiarity with your project's coding standards and architecture
- Related: KB-026 (How to create a pull request using Claude Code Web)

## Steps

### Step 1: Access the PR Summary
Navigate to your GitHub repository and locate the pull request created by Claude Code Web. The PR will contain:
- A title describing the main change
- A detailed description/summary section
- File changes and diffs
- Optional test outputs and changelog excerpts

**In Claude Code Web interface:**
After Claude completes a task, it will display a link to the created PR. Click this link to view the full PR on GitHub.

```
Task completed! PR created: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/123
```

### Step 2: Review the PR Description Structure
Claude-generated PR descriptions typically follow this format:

```markdown
## Summary
- [Bullet points describing what changed]
- [Key implementation details]
- [Notable architectural decisions]

## Test plan
- [Testing approach used]
- [Test cases covered]
- [Manual verification steps if applicable]
```

**What to verify:**
- Does the summary accurately describe ALL changes in the diff?
- Are the bullet points clear and specific (not vague)?
- Does it explain the "why" behind changes, not just the "what"?

### Step 3: Cross-Reference Summary with Code Changes
Open the "Files changed" tab in the PR and systematically verify:

**Accuracy Check:**
- Does each change mentioned in the summary actually exist in the code?
- Are there any code changes NOT mentioned in the summary?
- Do the file paths and function names match what's described?

**Example verification:**
If the summary says "Updated user authentication in `auth/login.ts`", confirm:
```bash
# In the Files changed tab, look for:
auth/login.ts - [number] additions, [number] deletions
```

### Step 4: Evaluate the Test Plan
Review the test plan section for completeness:

**Key questions:**
- Are all new features covered by tests?
- Does it address edge cases and error conditions?
- Are integration points tested (APIs, databases, external services)?
- Does it mention test outputs or results?

**Red flags:**
- Generic statements like "tests were added" without specifics
- Missing test coverage for critical paths
- No mention of how to verify the changes manually

### Step 5: Check for Risk Assessment
Look for mentions of:
- Breaking changes or backwards compatibility
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Dependencies added or updated

**If missing, ask Claude to add this:**
In your Claude Code Web session, use:
```
Update PR #123 to include a risk assessment section covering
breaking changes, performance impact, and security considerations.
```

### Step 6: Verify Technical Accuracy
Review specific technical claims in the summary:

**Code patterns:**
- Are described patterns actually implemented correctly?
- Do error handling approaches match the description?
- Are state management updates accurately described?

**Dependencies:**
- Check `package.json` or equivalent for any mentioned library additions
- Verify version numbers match what's stated

### Step 7: Assess Completeness for Reviewers
Consider if the summary provides enough context for team members:

**Essential elements:**
- Purpose/motivation for the change
- Scope of impact (which modules/features affected)
- Suggestions for what reviewers should focus on
- Links to related issues or documentation

**Optional but valuable:**
- Screenshots or demo videos for UI changes
- Performance benchmarks for optimization work
- Migration notes for breaking changes

### Step 8: Review Attached Artifacts
Claude may attach additional context to the PR:

**Common attachments:**
- Test output logs
- Changelog excerpts
- Build/lint results
- Coverage reports

**Validation steps:**
- Confirm test outputs show all tests passing
- Check that no new warnings or errors were introduced
- Verify coverage hasn't decreased significantly

### Step 9: Validate Against Project Standards
If you have a `CLAUDE.md` file defining coding standards:

**Check alignment:**
- Does the implementation follow documented patterns?
- Are naming conventions consistent with project style?
- Does it meet security requirements specified?
- Are accessibility standards addressed if applicable?

**Example CLAUDE.md standards:**
```markdown
## Code Review Checklist
- All functions must have TypeScript type annotations
- Error handling must use try-catch with specific error types
- All user inputs must be validated
- New features require corresponding tests
```

### Step 10: Request Summary Improvements (If Needed)
If the summary is incomplete or inaccurate, ask Claude to regenerate it:

**In Claude Code Web:**
```
Review PR #123 and update the description to include:
- More specific details about the authentication flow changes
- Test coverage for the edge case when tokens expire
- Performance impact of the new caching layer
- Breaking changes for API consumers
```

Claude will analyze the changes again and update the PR description on GitHub.

## Expected Results
After completing this review process, you should have:

✅ **Verified accuracy** - The summary matches all code changes
✅ **Complete context** - Reviewers have sufficient information to understand the change
✅ **Risk awareness** - Potential issues and impacts are documented
✅ **Test confidence** - Testing approach is clear and comprehensive
✅ **Standards compliance** - Changes align with project guidelines

The PR is now ready for team review with a high-quality, accurate summary that accelerates the review process.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue 1
**Problem**: The PR summary is too vague or generic (e.g., "Updated files and added functionality")

**Solution**:
```
Regenerate the PR description for #123 with specific details about:
- Which exact functions/classes were modified
- What specific functionality was added
- Concrete examples of the new behavior
```

Claude will create a more detailed summary by re-analyzing the git diff.

### Common Issue 2
**Problem**: The summary mentions changes that don't exist in the code

**Solution**: This can happen if Claude's context became outdated. Request a fresh analysis:
```
Re-analyze all changes in PR #123 and update the description
to accurately reflect only the changes present in the current diff.
```

### Common Issue 3
**Problem**: Critical information is missing (like breaking changes or migration steps)

**Solution**: Explicitly request the missing sections:
```
Add a "Breaking Changes" section to PR #123 describing:
- What APIs or interfaces changed
- Migration steps for existing users
- Deprecation timeline if applicable
```

### Common Issue 4
**Problem**: Test plan doesn't match the actual tests in the PR

**Solution**:
```
Review the test files in PR #123 and update the test plan
section to accurately describe the tests that were actually implemented.
```

## Additional Tips

- **Use multi-Claude verification**: For critical PRs, have a separate Claude Code session review the first Claude's summary for accuracy (as suggested in Anthropic's best practices)

- **Template customization**: Create a custom PR template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to ensure Claude includes your required sections

- **Automated checks**: Set up GitHub Actions to validate that PR descriptions meet minimum length/section requirements

- **Changelog integration**: If maintaining a CHANGELOG.md, verify that significant changes are also documented there, not just in the PR

- **Link to issues**: Ensure the PR references related GitHub issues using keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456"

- **Review summary early**: Ask Claude to generate a summary before creating the PR, allowing you to provide feedback and have it refined before submission

- **Bookmark key PRs**: Use Claude-generated summaries as documentation by linking to exemplary PRs in your project wiki
