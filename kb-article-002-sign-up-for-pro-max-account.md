## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue 1
**Problem**: Payment fails or card is declined
**Solution**:
- Verify your card details are entered correctly
- Ensure your card has sufficient funds
- Check if your card supports international transactions (Anthropic may process payments internationally)
- Try a different payment method if available
- Contact your bank if the issue persists

### Common Issue 2
**Problem**: Email verification link not received
**Solution**:
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Verify you entered the correct email address
- Request a new verification email
- Wait a few minutes, as delivery can sometimes be delayed
- Try adding noreply@anthropic.com or similar to your email contacts

### Common Issue 3
**Problem**: Subscription shows as active but can't access Claude Code Web
**Solution**:
- Log out of your Claude account and log back in
- Clear your browser cache and cookies
- Try accessing `claude.com/code` in an incognito/private window
- Wait 5-10 minutes for the subscription to fully propagate
- Contact Anthropic support if the issue persists beyond 30 minutes

### Common Issue 4
**Problem**: Unsure which plan to choose (Pro vs Max)
**Solution**:
- Start with **Claude Pro** if you:
  - Are an individual developer
  - Work on 1-3 projects at a time
  - Have moderate coding assistance needs

- Choose **Claude Max** if you:
  - Manage multiple projects simultaneously
  - Need to run many parallel coding tasks
  - Have intensive development workflows
  - Work on a professional development team

You can always upgrade from Pro to Max later if your needs increase.

## Additional Tips
- Consider starting with a Pro subscription and upgrading to Max if you find you need more concurrent tasks
- Both Pro and Max give you access to the same Claude Code Web features; the main difference is concurrent task limits
- Your subscription gives you access to both regular Claude chat and Claude Code Web
- Keep your payment information up to date to avoid service interruptions
- Subscription management (upgrades, downgrades, cancellations) is typically available in account settings
